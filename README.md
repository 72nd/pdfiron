Pdfiron is basically a part-reimplementation of [pdfsandwich](http://www.tobias-elze.de/pdfsandwich/index.html). Thus it uses [unpaper](https://github.com/unpaper/unpaper) to optimize the documents and [Å§esseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) for OCR. The main motivation was to support the splitting of double layouts (two book pages per scanned page in the input file) into individual pages in the output document. It's also possible to skip Tesseract and produce optimized documents faster.


## Motivation and Example

Studying human sciences at university demands reading lots of text. Frustratingly these are often provided as nearly unreadable scans. Further on this documents contain almost always only an image of the scanned pages, thus it's not possible to copy any content out of this files. This tool combines a number of different applications to provide readable PDF's. By default pdfiron also applies Optical character recognition ([OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)) to your document, providing you with copyable text within the resulting PDF.

For an example, take this scan from Friedrich Nietzsches [Also sprach Zarathustra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Also_sprach_Zarathustra):

## Technical details


- Pdfiron supports the splitting of double layout pages (two pages per sheet) into two individual output pages.
- The execution of tesseract is optional.

Pdfiron makes full usage of multi core systems and distributes the work of each step on as many cores as available on the system.


## Installation

Pdfiron depends on a number of applications to perform it's task:

- ImageMagick's [`convert`](https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) application for converting PDF's into images.
- `pdfinfo` and `pdfunite` from the [Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) project.
- [`unpaper`](https://github.com/unpaper/unpaper) to perform the document optimization.
- [`tesseract`](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and it's language file for OCR.

Under Debian based system you can install the dependencies with the following packages:

```shell script
apt install imagemagick unpaper poppler tesseract-ocr

# Do not forget to install the language packages for tesseract:
apt install tesseract-ocr-eng tesseract-ocr-deu
```

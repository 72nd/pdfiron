# pdfiron

Basically a part reimplementation of [pdfsandwich](http://www.tobias-elze.de/pdfsandwich/index.html). Thus it uses [unpaper](https://github.com/unpaper/unpaper) to optimize the documents and [Å§esseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) for OCR. Motivation for this project:

- Pdfiron supports the splitting of double layout pages (two pages per sheet) into two individual output pages.
- The execution of tesseract is optional.
